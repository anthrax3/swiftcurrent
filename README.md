# swiftcurrent
Swiftcurrent is a 3 part Django python web application which utilizes current text information 
from the web to rate the hype or public attention towards certain objects and sites. 

Part one: The project has crawlers which find and capture specific patterns of text for analysis. 

Part two:  A game will be used for real live user input which we can sift through to make connections 
between data sets within our data base. 

Part three:  The algorithm which shall utilize information from both the "game" and the crawlers to make
connections between the current data and already known data. This will give us the rating/ranking for objects 
which we wish to look at.
